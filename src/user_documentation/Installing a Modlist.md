# Installing a Modlist

Every Modlist comes with its own README containing information and instructions on how to install it correctly. You should definitely read the Modlist specific README if you want a successful installation.

**The core procedure for using the Gallery is:**

1) Open Wabbajack and Navigate to the Gallery
2) Decide on a List to install
3) Click the download button
4) Wait for the first download of the .wabbajack file to finish
5) When it is done click the play button where previously you had the download button
6) Open and read the specific readme of the list you are about to install
7) Select the paths for where the list should be installed
   - Installation Location: The location where the files required to play will be installed to
     - Can't be set to Game Location
     - Can't be the same as another list (lists can't be merged)
     - Can't be in a Windows OS managed folder
   - Download Location: The location where the downloaded archives are stored.
     - Can share the same location as the downloads folders of other lists (avoids duplicate downloads)
     - Don't merge download locations if you plan to create and share your own modlists, because Wabbajack can't really differentiate which archives are the ones it needs and which just have similar files.
8) Wait till Wabbajack is done
9) Go back to the readme (which will open automatically) and complete any final steps mentioned there

**The core procedure for using a downloaded .wabbajack file:**

If you have used Wabbajack before skip to step 3.

1) Open Wabbajack and Navigate to `install from disk`
2) Select the .wabbajack file as the `Target Modlist`
3) Open and read the specific readme of the list you are about to install
4) Select the paths for where the list should be installed
   - Installation Location: The location where the files required to play will be installed to
     - Can't be set to Game Location
     - Can't be the same as another list (lists can't be merged)
     - Can't be in a Windows OS managed folder
   - Download Location: The location where the downloaded archives are stored.
     - Can share the same location as the downloads folders of other lists (avoids duplicate downloads)
     - Can't be set to Game Location
     - Can't be in a Windows OS managed folder
     - Don't merge download locations if you plan to create and share your own modlists, because Wabbajack can't really differentiate which archives are the ones it needs and which just have similar files.
5) Wait till Wabbajack is done
6) Go back to the readme (which will open automatically) and complete any final steps mentioned there

Do note that installation can take anything from a few minutes to hours depending on the size of the Modlist, your Internet connection as well as your hardware. In the meantime you can take a look at some of the included mods of the Modlist in the Slideshow that is playing during installation.

**What is a Windows OS manager folder?**

Windows, as a Operating System, has some protection over specific folders.
These are;
  - C:\Windows\
  - C:\Users\username\Documents\
  - C:\Users\username\Images\
  - C:\Users\username\Videos\
  - C:\Users\username\OneDrive\
  - C:\Program Files\
  - C:\Program Files (x86)\

It is highly recommended you don't have your Game, Wabbajack, modlist, and the modlist downloads in any of these folders.
