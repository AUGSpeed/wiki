# Introduction

Modlist Creation or Compilation as we call it, is a trial and error process. You will likely get a decent amount of compilation errors in the beginning and have to spent some time fixing them before your first compilation succeeds. After that you can do incremental builds which take significantly less time and have close to zero errors compared to your first build. In short the main requirement is an eagerness to learn and a willingness to fall on your nose a few times while doing so.

## Requirements

Wabbajack requires that you created your Modlist using a [**portable**](Compilation%20Issues%20FAQ.html#portable-instances) version of Mod Organizer 2. This is a **hard requirement** for the intended and fully supported Wabbajack experience. Wabbajack won't work with Vortex, Kortex, Wyre Bash, Nexus Mod Manager, Oblivion Mod Manager or any other Mod Manager, not even Mod Organizer 1. At least not without some really hard drawbacks and complications.

There is an option for compiling free of any Mod Manager, but that option isn't tested a lot and comes with more manual instructions needed for the people interested in installing your modlist. The option for this is the [Native-Game-Installer - (Installers not using MO2)](Native-Game-Installer%20-%20(Installers%20not%20using%20MO2).md).

Aside from needed a portable MO2 installation or using the "Native Game Installer" way you need to have a specific setup and workflow when modding that will be explained in the following chapters.
